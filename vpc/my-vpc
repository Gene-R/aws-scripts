VPC - it is much like home or corporate network where you can deploy db servers, and other servers, apps. In general  - to host servers.
Cloud computing is used to setup you servers.

- create your vpc
- NACL
- Security group
- Routing tables
- Internet GW makes you subnet publically accessible. Make your private subnet public from Inboud perspective.
- NAT gateway connect you private subnet with INternet, bit only for Outbound traffic. E.g. to download something (updates, etc)
- Virtual GW - creates connection between your VPC and you your corporate network
- VPC peering - is used to connect two different VPCs to allow communication between private subnetworks.
For cross region you can also setup peering or communcation over public Elastic IP addresses vor secured protocls (e.g. ssh).
- Direct connect - direct dedicated connection to AWS - it is bypass Internet.

If internet has a internet gateway in its route table, then it is a public subnet. Otherwise it's not.

NAT gateways provides better availability and bandwidth compared to NAT instances

NAT instance is launched from NAT AMI instance - typically linux image configured to perform NAT
NAT Gateway is a managed service - does not require any administration efforts. It allows you to connect your private subnet to Internet.

NACL rules - the first mutch will be used.

default limits:
5 VPC per region
200 subnet per VPC
5 elastic IP address per Region

Active Directory - is basically authentication database where some companies keep user and passwords


ASN - anonymous system number used by BGP (border gateway protocol)

VPC has - CIDR bloks and NACL
Subnet has - Route tables and NACL
